  "title": "Master's graduate in Materials Science and Engineering",
  "summary": "Masterâ€™s graduate in Materials Science and Engineering with a strong focus on welding, dissimilar material joining, and thermomechanical processing. My academic and R&D experience centers on aluminum alloys, friction stir welding, pressure vessels, and heat exchanger technologies. I have also worked extensively with numerical simulation tools to model heat transfer, material flow, and mechanical behavior in welded structures. I am particularly interested in the interplay between manufacturing methods, microstructural evolution, and mechanical performance in high-performance engineering applications.",
